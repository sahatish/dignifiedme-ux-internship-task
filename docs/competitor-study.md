## Competitor Study

The following platforms were reviewed to understand how high-trust hiring and service discovery
is handled, and what UX patterns work or fail in reducing decision anxiety.

------------------------------------------------

## 1. Toptal

- First CTA: “Hire Top Talent” with an application-style flow
- Trust design: Strong emphasis on vetting, exclusivity, and quality screening
- Choice reduction: Users are matched instead of browsing large lists
- Steal: Guided matching flow that removes decision fatigue
- Avoid: Lack of transparency on pricing and timelines early in the flow

------------------------------------------------

## 2. Upwork

- First CTA: “Post a Job” or “Find Talent”
- Trust design: Ratings, reviews, job success score
- Choice reduction: Minimal — relies heavily on search and filters
- Steal: Rich freelancer profiles with work history and feedback
- Avoid: Overwhelming number of options leading to comparison paralysis

------------------------------------------------

## 3. Clutch

- First CTA: “Find Companies” by service and location
- Trust design: Verified reviews, case studies, client references
- Choice reduction: Category and location-based shortlisting
- Steal: Detailed case studies that help users assess execution capability
- Avoid: Time-consuming evaluation process with limited guided recommendations
