## User Journey & Information Architecture

The user journey is designed to guide founders from initial uncertainty
to a confident execution decision with minimal cognitive load.

------------------------------------------------

 ## User Intent

The user arrives with a high-level idea or requirement but limited clarity on:
- Required roles
- Engagement model
- Cost and execution complexity

------------------------------------------------

Step-by-Step User Journey

## 1. Entry / Landing
   - User understands the purpose of the platform
   - Clear messaging that this is a guided execution platform, not a talent marketplace

## 2. City Selection
   - User selects their operating city (e.g., Bengaluru, Pune, Ahmedabad)
   - City context sets availability, coordination, and vendor relevance

## 3. Engagement Recommendation
   - Platform recommends either:
     a) Individual Expert
     b) Cluster / Execution Team
   - Recommendation is supported by a short explanation

## 4. Shortlisted Options
   - User sees 2–3 relevant freelancers or clusters
   - Each option highlights specialization, trust signals, and engagement model

## 5. Comparison & Validation
   - User compares options on experience, past work, cost range, and timelines
   - Trust signals reduce perceived risk

## 6. Commitment Step
   - User takes a low-risk next step:
     - Request proposal
     - Book an intro call
     - Reserve availability
