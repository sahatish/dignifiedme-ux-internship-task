Key UX Decisions

------------------------------------------------

1. Guided Recommendation Instead of Open Search  
Users are shown recommended engagement types and limited options to reduce decision fatigue and increase confidence.

------------------------------------------------

2. City-First Flow  
City selection is placed early to ensure relevance, improve coordination feasibility, and build realistic expectations.

------------------------------------------------

3. Low-Risk Commitment Actions  
Instead of forcing immediate hiring, the platform encourages low-risk actions like calls and proposals to build trust gradually.
