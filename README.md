Dignifiedme Internship Qualification Task  
City-Based Cluster + Marketplace Platform (UI/UX Case Study)

---

##1. Problem Overview

Early-stage electronics and hardware startups often face a major gap between having an idea and executing it successfully.  
The difficulty is rarely just about finding people, it’s about understanding *who* to hire, *how* to evaluate quality, and *how* to move forward with confidence.

Founders are required to make high-impact decisions involving cost, timelines, and long-term collaboration, often without enough clarity or guidance.  
This platform is intended to support those decisions by providing structured, city-based recommendations, vetted talent options, and clear execution paths.
